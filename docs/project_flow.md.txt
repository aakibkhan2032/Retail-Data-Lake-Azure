# Project Flow – Cloud-Based Retail Data Lake

## 1. Data Ingestion
- Raw e-commerce data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
- Data is ingested into the Bronze layer using PySpark in Azure Databricks.
- No transformations are applied at this stage to preserve raw data.

## 2. Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data in Delta format.
- Acts as a source of truth for downstream processing.
- Enables reprocessing and auditing if business logic changes.

## 3. Silver Layer
- Applies data quality checks such as:
  - Null value handling
  - Deduplication using primary keys (order_id)
- Enforces schema consistency.
- Produces cleaned and standardized datasets.

## 4. Gold Layer
- Contains aggregated and analytics-ready data.
- Optimized for reporting and querying.
- Supports business use cases such as sales analysis and customer insights.

## 5. Data Access
- Data can be accessed using:
  - `spark.read.table()` for registered Delta tables
  - Spark SQL for analytical queries
- Gold layer data can be integrated with SQL-based reporting systems.

## 6. Technologies Used
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Databricks
- PySpark
- Delta Lake
