## 🏛️ Medallion Architecture Overview

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** design pattern to build a **scalable, reliable, and analytics-ready data lake**.  
The architecture organizes data into clearly defined layers, each with a specific responsibility, enabling high data quality and maintainability.

### 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Raw Layer**
   - Raw e-commerce CSV data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)**.
   - Data is preserved in its original form for traceability and reprocessing.

2. **Bronze Layer**
   - Raw data is ingested into **Delta Lake** using **Azure Databricks**.
   - No business transformations are applied.
   - Acts as the immutable source of truth.

3. **Silver Layer**
   - Applies data quality and standardization rules:
     - Deduplication using primary keys
     - Referential integrity validation
     - Regex-based timestamp validation and safe casting
     - Text normalization and NULL handling
   - Produces clean, consistent, and analysis-ready datasets.

4. **Gold Layer**
   - Implements a **Star Schema** with fact and dimension tables.
   - Stores business-level, analytics-ready data.
   - Optimized for reporting, aggregations, and BI use cases.

5. **Serving & Analytics Layer**
   - Gold tables are exported as CSV files for downstream consumption.
   - Data is loaded into **Microsoft SQL Server** for analytical querying and reporting.

### ⭐ Key Benefits

- **Improved Data Quality**  
  Data is validated and standardized before reaching analytics consumers.

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**  
  Each layer has a single responsibility, simplifying development and maintenance.

- **Ease of Debugging & Reprocessing**  
  Issues can be traced and fixed at the appropriate layer without impacting others.

- **Scalability & Performance**  
  Delta Lake enables efficient storage, versioning, and scalable processing.

- **Cost Optimization**  
  Compute (Databricks) is decoupled from storage and used only when required.

This layered approach closely mirrors **real-world enterprise data platforms** and ensures that data is reliable, reusable, and analytics-ready.
