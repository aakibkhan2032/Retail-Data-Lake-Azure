- **Raw Layer**
  - Original CSV files are stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)**.
  - Data is preserved in its original format to maintain traceability and support reprocessing.

- **Bronze Layer**
  - Raw data is ingested into Azure Databricks and stored in **Delta Lake format**.
  - No transformations are applied at this stage.

- **Silver Layer**
  - Cleaned and standardized datasets are produced by applying:
